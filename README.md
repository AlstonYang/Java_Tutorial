Topics include classes, interfaces, operators, program control, arrays, testing, debugging, inheritance, and polymorphism; Techniques for simplifying the programming process and improving code quality; Features activity-based learning with ample opportunities to implement interesting programs.

Objectives: 
Upon successful completion, the student will be able to do the following:
•	Employ a ‘divide and conquer’ problem-solving strategy to breakdown a complex programming assignment into a series of simpler tasks. 
•	Understand and make proper use of core programming concepts such as data types, operators, and control structures in Java
•	Effectively use Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to develop and manage Java software projects 
•	Write human-readable code that complies with generally-accepted coding style guidelines, including generation of HTML-based documentation.
•	Develop programs that appropriately utilize object-oriented concepts such as abstract classes, inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism
•	Write effective in-code comments and generate documentation using JavaDoc tools
